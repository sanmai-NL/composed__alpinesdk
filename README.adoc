Using this project, you can develop http://www.alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Linux] https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Developer_Documentation#Building_from_source_and_creating_packages[Aports packages] easily from your existing, non-Alpine Linux workstation.

Please issue all of the following shell statements from within the root directory of this repository.

== To deploy the project

=== Configure the deployment

Take a look at link:.env[`.env`].
It contains shell variables relevant to the build.

. `APORTS_REPO_URL`: an URL to a Git remote with the Aports repository.
The default is normally okay.
. `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`: the Docker Compose project name to deploy as.
The default is normally okay.
. `LOCAL_APORTS_DIR`: the path to a directory on your Docker host that contains the Aports Git repository.
. `REGISTRY`: the Docker registry that the dependency image has been tagged as belonging to.
The default is normally okay.

== Perform the deployment

NOTE: In the following, substitute `fish` with the name of a shell executable, e.g. `bash`.

[source,sh]
----
sh -a -c -x -- '. ".env" && fish -i'
----

=== Clone the Aports Git repository to your Docker host

In case you do not yet have a local clone of the Aports Git repository, clone it:

[source,sh]
----
git clone "${APORTS_REPO_URL}" "${LOCAL_APORTS_DIR}"
----

=== Configure `abuild` on your Docker host

In case you do not yet have an `abuild` configuration, issue:

[source,sh]
----
mkdir -- ~/.abuild/
----

=== Configure the container

You may also take a look at link:recipes/.alpine-developer.env[`recipes/.alpine-developer.env`].
It contains shell variables relevant to your activities within the container.
These will be environment variables within your container.
They affect C/C++ source code builds.
The defaults are aimed to minimize the time to complete builds.

=== Deploy

[source,sh]
----
cd 'recipes/'
sudo -E docker-compose create
sudo -E docker-compose start
----

=== Configure `abuild` within the container

In case you did not yet have an `abuild` configuration, assumed to already contain key pair, generate a key pair. Issue the following from within the container:

[source,sh]
----
if [ ! -f "$HOME/.abuild/abuild.conf" ] ; then
    abuild-keygen \
        --append \
        --install \
        -n ;
    sudo abuild-sign -k ~/.abuild/*.rsa /var/cache/apk/APKINDEX.*
else
    sudo -- cp -- "$HOME"/.abuild/*.pub '/etc/apk/keys/' ;
fi ;
----

=== Use

Assuming the container you just created and started is the first, and thus named `alpinesdk_alpine-sdk_1`, issue:

[source,sh]
----
sudo docker exec -ti 'alpinesdk_alpine-sdk_1' '/bin/sh'
----
